The AI-generated responses using these templates are not a replacement for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read or generated by an AI model.
If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your doctor or emergency services immediately.

Ethical Precautions:
1. The AI-generated responses should be used to supplement, not replace, the guidance of a licensed therapist or counselor.
2. Always prioritize the user's safety and well-being. If the user expresses thoughts of self-harm or harm to others, seek immediate professional help.
3. Maintain confidentiality and privacy of the user's information.
