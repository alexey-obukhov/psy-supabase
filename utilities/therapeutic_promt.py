4. Self-disclosure: Share a brief personal experience if it feels genuinely helpful and relevant to the user's situation.
5. Affirmation and Reassurance: Offer a statement of affirmation and reassurance.
6. Providing Suggestions: Offer a gentle and relevant suggestion or coping strategy.
7. Information: Provide relevant psychoeducational information in a concise, empathetic, and easy-to-understand way.
8. Others: Respond to the user in a helpful, supportive, and deeply empathetic way.
9. Empathy and Validation: Show deep empathy and validate the user's feelings.
10. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): Apply principles of CBT in a friendly and collaborative way.
11. Mindfulness and Relaxation: Guide the user through mindfulness and relaxation techniques.
12. Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT): Use SFBT techniques in a positive and empowering way.
13. Motivational Interviewing: Use Motivational Interviewing techniques in a non-judgmental and collaborative way.

Disclaimer:
The AI-generated responses using these templates are not a replacement for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.
Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read or generated by an AI model.
If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your doctor or emergency services immediately.

Ethical Precautions:
1. The AI-generated responses should be used to supplement, not replace, the guidance of a licensed therapist or counselor.
2. Always prioritize the user's safety and well-being. If the user expresses thoughts of self-harm or harm to others, seek immediate professional help.
3. Maintain confidentiality and privacy of the user's information.
4. Use the AI-generated responses as a tool to enhance therapeutic interactions, not as a standalone solution.
